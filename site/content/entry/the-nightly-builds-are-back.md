As you all know, the Nightly builds have been down for some time now due to the former maintainer not being around, but the issues have been resolved, and the Nightly builds are now available on our [downloads page](https://citra-emu.org/download/) once again! With downloads available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, you're no longer required to compile the build yourself.

Likewise, we'd like to remind all users that any bugs found within Citra, or during emulation, be reported from the Nightly builds, and not the Bleeding Edge ones. From hereon out, support for the latter will no longer be given. If you believe you've found a bug in Bleeding Edge, please retest on the latest Nightly build. Thank you everyone for your patience, and Happy New Year!
