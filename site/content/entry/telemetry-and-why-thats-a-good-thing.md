Citra has some [issues](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/issues), we've always been transparent in what they are, and have always allowed anyone to contribute to it. Unfortunately though, most contributions are made by [a small minority of developers](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/graphs/contributors). These developers have found it difficult to prioritize their efforts, since the issues are mostly reported outside of the GitHub tracker, on the forums, on chats, and elsewhere. Not to mention that most of the reports are too vague, are missing vital information such as the logs or system info, or both. Because of this, we found that the best choice would simply be to collect anonymous information about our users, and use that data to find things like where users crash most often, what are the most popular games and hardware configurations, and so on. We had considered including this in last month's progress report, but we decided that it would be best to publish this on its own, so it gets the attention it deserves.
