Fall arrives once more, and like I mentioned in [last month's progress report](/entry/citra-progress-report-2017-august),
I am extremely excited for what's in store. In fact, many of the really big goodies
I've decided to seperate to their own articles, which should be coming up in the
next few weeks.

There's also been many changes this month that improve the speed of emulation across
the board, on top of the usual improvements in accuracy and features. And because
of that, I've dubbed this month #Speedtember. Let's dive right in.
