Hey there, Citra fans!
It's been a few months since our Android version released and its reception has been absolutely wonderful.
We wanted to take this opportunity to make an announcement and answer a few questions many of you have had.

# App Installs

Citra Android has now reached 500,000+ installs on the Google Play Store!

This is an absolutely incredible achievement and your enthusiasm is a big factor in what drives development of the app.
Thank you all for your support!

# Save States Announcement

At the time of release, we said that we would put our efforts into bringing feature parity between the desktop and Android versions.
We have now released around a dozen updates in the past few months, with each one bringing us closer to that goal.
Today is no different, we are happy to announce another update to Citra Android featuring support for [Save States](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-android/pull/180).
Thanks to [zhaowenlan1779](https://github.com/zhaowenlan1779), you can now easily farm those shinies in your favourite Pokémon games or create quicksaves right before the toughest bosses, all on your mobile phone!

Check it out in the [Google Play Store now](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.citra.citra_emu)!

<p style="color:red";><b>Reminder: Do <i>not</i> rely on Save States entirely. Remember to create normal saves occasionally to prevent loss of progress in the event the save state becomes corrupt or incompatible with a future version of Citra.</b></p>

# Additional Questions

We would also like to address any concerns regarding a slowdown in development on Citra Android.

Due to the nature of the Google Play Store, we are only able to release updates when enough improvement warrants a new release. Google seems to arbitrarily reject our updates and this has caused weeks of delays in the past, but we're doing our best to work around these issues and push out builds that have new features, improved stability, and better performance.

Citra Android also greatly benefits from most improvements to the Desktop version of Citra. We are actively looking for a dedicated Android developer to step up and focus on Android specific improvments, but in the meantime, our developers are doing the best they can to eventually reach feature parity with the Desktop version.

We appreciate your continued support and patience. An emulator without a community to enjoy it is a sad sight, so we are ecstatic that we have such an incredible community surrounding Citra.

We hope you continue to enjoy Citra, whether it's on your PC or Android device, and can't wait to bring future improvements to you all!
