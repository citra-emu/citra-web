If you haven't heard of [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) yet, it's basically an alternative to Skype, featuring servers with both voice and text chat. You can use it in your browser, download the desktop program, or get the mobile app.

If you don't have an account already, you can make one for free [here](https://discordapp.com/register).

Once you've done that, you can join Citra's official server by going [here](https://discord.gg/fZwvKPu).

There are 5 channels:

* #read-first - A read-only introduction to the server, and announcements.
* #citra-general - Any discussion related to Citra.
* #citra-support - If you are having trouble with Citra, you can ask for help here. **Please read #read-first, first.**
* #dumping-support - Support for dumping games/system files for Citra.
* #offtopic - Anything not related to Citra that doesn't belong in #citra-general goes here.

The [Citra](https://citra-emu.org/rules/) Community Rules also apply to this server.

Have fun!
