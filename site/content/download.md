The nightly build of Citra contains already reviewed and tested features. If you require support with the installation or use of Citra, or you want to report bugs you should use this version. This version is still in development, so expect crashes and bugs.

The Bleeding Edge build of Citra is the same as our nightly builds, with additional features that are still waiting on review before making it into the official Citra builds. We will not provide support for issues found only in this version. If you believe you've found a bug, please retest on our nightly builds. This version is still in development, so expect crashes and bugs.
